**Paddy Rice Imagery Dataset for Panicle Segmentation** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 400 images with 50730 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*panicle*).

Images in the Paddy Rice Imagery dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (243 images), *test* (100 images), and *val* (57 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, China and Hokkaido University, Japan.
